This type of Turing machine is also known as a multi-tape Turing machine.The basic structure of a multi-tape Turing machine is similar to that of a standard Turing machine, but with multiple tapes. For example, a multi-tape Turing machine can perform certain operations in parallel, which can reduce the number of steps required to solve a problem.The use of multiple tapes in a Turing machine is a theoretical concept, and is not typically used in practical computing
